        <p>Popularly known as the "wine and grape capital" of India, Nashik is blessed with natural beauty, cultural
            heritage, and rich history. “Panchvati”, the place where Lord Rama lived with his wife Sita and brother
            Laxman during his 14-years of exile from Ajodhya, is a part of the beautiful city Nashik itself.</p>
